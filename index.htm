                    <p>
                        I have noticed a common trend throughout my life, I am someone who relentlessly has a strategy. Having a plan is what sets me apart, as the great Benjamin Franklin used the quote <span>“Failing to plan is planning to fail.”</span>  I can say I am proud of looking at my accomplishments that this strategy has worked for me, through planning I have seen continuous improvement in my work. For example, in my undergraduate degree in the first year, my average was 60%, the second year was 66% and the third and final year was 70%. I believe continuous improvement is the skill I value the most, being able to reflect on your performance and improve with hard work and dedication. Planning and continuous improvement is 2 skills which foster lifelong learning and makes me an excellent candidate for any company.

                    Plumpets is a no kill animal shelter run by Paulette who re-homes and rescues thousands of dogs and cats. Paulette is one of my role models, an epitome of compassion. She has dedicated her whole life to the well-being of the animals, taking in animals no other shelter would as well as caring personally for the ones who are too sickly, too old or who never get adopted. I have had the pleasure of volunteering with Plumpets frequently for quite lengthy time now. This experience has definitely shaped my people skills, I am more mindful, emphatic, confident and team orientated.

                        •	Leadership: I teach grade 7-9 the foundations of computer science. Teaching the learners has fostered a sense of pride in me. I feel so optimistic whenever I see these learners able to create basic websites from no web development knowledge at all. My guidance has developed excitement and passion for computer science as whole for these learners, it’s amazing to be able to share my passion with others.
